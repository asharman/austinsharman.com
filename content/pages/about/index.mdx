I'm a coffee loving software developer and pug dad from Orlando, FL.

This site is my [digital garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden) where you will find posts that explore writing software for the web, learning, and teaching among other things.

I currently work full-time as a Web Developer at [Three21 Creative](https://321theagency.com/).
